# Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data

**Instructions**: In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

 I originally created this project in PyCharm, but later moved it over to Jupyter Notebook. We were tasked with writing code to provide the following info, based on user input:

## 1 - Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
  *	most common month
  *	most common day of week
  *	most common hour of day
  
## 2 - Popular stations and trip
  *	most common start station
  *	most common end station
  *	most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

## 3 - Trip duration
  *	total travel time
  *	average travel time

## 4 - User info
  *	counts of each user type
  *	counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  *	earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
